Just deployed the [Blackjack game](https://blackjack-sinatra-jw.herokuapp.com) to heroku and this marks the end of [TeaLeaf Academy](https://www.gotealeaf.com) first course - Introduction to Ruby and Web Development.

I started the program on Oct 26th, 2014 and it took me exactly one month to complete the course. I wouldn't say it's a hard course, but absolutely not easy. It has been such a great experience for me that I would highly recommend. 

For future reference, I will list what I have done and learnt here.

##Concepts and tips to note

- *Namespace* is a way to group classes in Ruby and differentiate from other classes with the same name.

- To remove a directory with files inside, `rm -R dir`.

- Use pry to debugging.
```ruby
require 'pry'
binding.pry
```
- OOP introduction from [zetcode.com](http://zetcode.com/lang/rubytutorial/oop/).

- There are so manny more to write that I will put them in separate blogs.
