Just deployed the [Blackjack game](https://blackjack-sinatra-jw.herokuapp.com) to heroku and this marks the end of [TeaLeaf Academy](https://www.gotealeaf.com) first course - Introduction to Ruby and Web Development.

Oct 26th, 2014 is the date that I started the program and it took me exactly one month to complete the course. I wouldn't say it's a hard course, but absolutely not easy. It has been a great experience for me! 

For future reference, I will list what I have done and learnt here.

**Concepts and tips to note**
- *Namespace* is a way to group classes in Ruby and differentiate from other classes with the same name
- To remove a directory with files inside, `rm -R dir`
- Use pry to debugging
```ruby
require 'pry'
binding.pry
```
- Variable scope
**More is coming shortly**
