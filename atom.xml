    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just deployed the <a href="https://blackjack-sinatra-jw.herokuapp.com">Blackjack game</a> to heroku and this marks the end of <a href="https://www.gotealeaf.com">TeaLeaf Academy</a> first course - Introduction to Ruby and Web Development.</p>

<p>Oct 26th, 2014 is the date that I started the program and it took me exactly one month to complete the course. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a hard course, but absolutely not easy. It has been a great experience for me!</p>

<p>For future reference, I will list what I have done and learnt here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is Nov 23rd, 2014 and I just finished Lesson 3 on TeaLeaf Academy.</p>

<p>It has been three weeks since I joined the program and I was surprised by the progress I made. In three weeks, I built up three games in two different approach, procedural and OO. Then game Blackjack was upgraded from the command line to the web by using Sinatra. And today I have my own blog based on <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. This is awesome!</p>

<p>Before joining the program, I have been going through different tutorials online but in the end, I&rsquo;m still wondering where I should start and lacking confidence in building up web applications. After doing a lot of research and visiting bootcamps in Toronto, I chose TeaLeaf because it&rsquo;s online, cheaper and I don&rsquo;t need to quit my full time job. Its alumni also gave very positive feedback.</p>

<p>Why am I doing this? To make more money. Yes, that&rsquo;s why I started. But as I get more and more knowledge and practice, it becomes more and more interesting for me. I love it! Two hours a day from Monday to Friday and over 10 hours in the weekend were spent on it. I&rsquo;m addicted to it, like chocolate.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s a long process and requires patience and commitment to become really good at it. But it&rsquo;s never too late to start. I would like to record this experience and write down the tips I learnt and mistakes I made.</p>
